# Amazon Vine Program Analysis

## Overview 
- In this project we have been assigned to analyize the reviews written by members and non-members of the Amazon Vine Program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. In the final analysis we will be answering some questions such as if the reviews under the paid Vine Program are biased compared to the reviews written by non-members of the Vine Program.
